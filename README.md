# Reinforcement-Learning-project
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a Machine Learning technique in which an agent learns to interact with the environment, receiving "reward" or "punishment" signals depending on the actions it performs, in order to maximize the total reward in the long run term.

Q-learning and SARSA are two RL learning algorithms. Q-learning is an algorithm for learning the value of Q, which determines the best action in a particular situation.

SARSA, on the other hand, is another action value Q learning algorithm, which uses an on-policy approach, where the agent learns the Q value of the actions he is actually performing, so the agent learns select actions based on your current policy.

In summary, Q-learning and SARSA are both action value Q learning algorithms, which differ in the approach used to learn the Q value and the choice of action to take. Q-learning uses an off-policy approach, while SARSA uses an on-policy approach.
